>Busy, busy, busy, is what we Bokononists whisper whenever we think of how complicated and unpredictable the machinery of life really is.

### ML in Science
In my opinion, we are on the way to better understand the data that has been collected by various scientific disciplines in recent years. Much of the knowledge contained in this data has been made accessible through the methods of statistical learning in recent years. The pure hypothesis-based evaluation seems to be over, because this old statistical methods referred to data sets which were "very expansive" in the sense of difficult to create.  Methods which were for a long time rather neglected, are now on everyone's lips under the keyword "Deep Learning". They achieve incredible success in the area of perception with the right amount of data.
It is now up to us, to explore these methods and their possibilities, but also their inherent problems and thus generate new scientific knowledge.
